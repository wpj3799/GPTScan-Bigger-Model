# GPTScan

## Description

Using ChatGPT for logic vulnerability detection.

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies,

- Requires Python 3.10+
- Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Run GPTScan

For example, if the source code is stored in the `/source` directory, run the command:

```shell
python3.10 main.py -s /sourcecode -o /sourcecode/output.json -k OPEN_AI_API_KEY_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

3. Check the output

The output results are located at the location specified by the `-o` parameter, in the example above, it is located at `/sourcecode/output.json`.

## Supported Project Types

Currently supported project types include:
- Single file, i.e., a single `.sol` file
- Multi-file, i.e., a directory with multiple `.sol` files, without any other external dependencies
- Common framework projects, such as Truffle, Hardhat, Brownie, etc.

Tested frameworks include:
- Hardhad
- Truffle
- Brownie

Note that this project does not include the compilation environment, such as Node.js, which needs to be installed separately.
